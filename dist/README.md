## Description
* WeatherDashboard is a weather forecast-app that will give you the daily forecast for a desired city, as well as a five-day forecast for that city. Upon submission, your search will be saved in localStorage for you to access later.

## Installation
* 1. WeatherDashboard requires jQuery. You can find the CDN here: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery. 2. You also need to create an account on OpenWeatherMap.org to get an API access key for the weather API.

## Usage
* To use, simply enter a city into the input field under “Search for a City”. Then, press the submit button and the forecast will automatically be generated for you. Toggle between previous search buttons to pull up forecasts of previously searched cities.

## Contributing
* To contribute, simply fork the repository on GitHub and make pull requests. I will accept pull requests that improve the quality of the application.
